# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

To set up the environment use these commands in current directory:
```shell
npm init
npm install --dev-save hardhat
npx hardhat
```
Then choose your project.

If you are having any issue in Hardhat
checkout their official [docs](https://hardhat.org/docs).
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
